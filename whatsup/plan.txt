Server maintains a channel for each client, any message for that client will be put on that channel
which is being listened and items on that channel are sent to the connection.
Server also has a map from client name to its Client struct (channel and connection)
Client after sending CONNECT starts an endless loop which breaks only when the client has sent the DISCONNECT to server.
In the loop clients waits on reading from stdin. Input at stdin should be given as "<action> <username> <body>", where <username> and <body> can be empty string.
After reading from stdin, client parses and sends the action to the server.
